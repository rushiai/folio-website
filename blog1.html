Tableau can handle vast quantities of data from multiple data sources while Power BI can handle a relatively small amount of data, giving Tableau an additional point here. Power BI only handles up to 10 GB of data
Data Sources
Both platforms support a large number of data sources but tableau has a huge list of data connectivity options.
Data Shaping
Power BI has the extra edge here he gives the facility of Power Query editor that pretty much the same as excel. Where tableau doesn't give any of this facility
Data Modelling
Same as Power Query editor power bi also provide a specific feature to visualize data relationship that pretty much handy Tableau lack this feature.
Pricing
Power BI is priced lower than the Tableau. Power BI Pro start at $9.99 per user per month, Tableau Creator subscription costs $70 per user per month, and Tableau Explorer costs $35 per user per month, and Tableau Viewer costs $12 per user per month, which is slightly higher than the Power BI subscription.
Scalability
When it comes to scalability for larger data sets, Tableau has much greater scalability compared to Power BI.
Final Thoughts
Power BI can be a better choice for small businesses because it provides more accessible business solutions while Tableau allows large quantities of data points to be combined for analysis from various data sources, which is perfect for data scientists. Tableau and Power BI have their benefits and drawbacks, lots of similar features, and a few functionality gaps.
In conclusion, the option of the best business analytics software depends on the size and requirements of you or your company.
